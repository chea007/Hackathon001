<h1>5 Useful Products from Tropical Dry Forests</h1>

<h3>Skin/Fur<h3><p>Although only about 20% of animal skin is from animals caught in the wild, this still accounts for around 10 million animals. The skin and fur trade market heavily targets tropical dry forests because of some of the beautiful animals found there. One specific animal would be the Karakul sheep. Karakul sheep can be found in developing countries like Angola and Botswana, and countries with mass conflict, like Iran. Fur, like that obtained from Karakul sheep, is used in expensive Persian rugs and clothing. <br>
Since animals of prized fur primarily live in certain areas with tropical dry forest, the skin and fur industry positively impacts economies of those countries. Animals of highly sought after skin are the Bengal tiger (indigenous to the tropical forest of India) and other large cats.
<h3>Antidotes<h3><p>Just like anywhere else in the world, there are dangerous creatures within our biome. Antidotes are medicinal remedies used to counteract poisons. Some poisonous animals in the tropical dry forest biome are vampire bats, scorpions, and snakes. Venomous spiders are also present, especially in Costa Rica. An example of these spiders would be the Brazilian Wandering Spider. Countries with the technology to safely extract the venom and poisons from these animals and use them to make antidotes benefit from being able to trade with developing countries that have similar animals in their own tropical dry forests. Having a readily available and easily regenerable amount of antidotes is a valuable resource and advantage for any country’s economy, as long as the country is able to sustain a sufficient quantity and quality of remedies for venoms and poisons from animals indigenous to tropical forest biomes.</p>
<h3>Animal Horns<h3><p>Another coveted part of animals found in tropical dry forest are horns. So far I have noted how a resource can affect a national economy and trade, and now I would like to elaborate the same, except on the tribal level. Tropical dry forest are mostly present in Africa, and it is there tribes use horns from animals in the forest to display success and wealth. The White Rhino’s horns grow as much is 8 cm a year. Horns can also be made into dagger handles and daggers themselves. These unique items are generally used as used in replacement of paper currency. African tribes have been known to take natural resources like horns and give them unique characteristics that pertain to their tribe, then use them as trade items or peace offerings.</p>
